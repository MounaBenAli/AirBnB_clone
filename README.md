# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description :school:

HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, 
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.


## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the 
[FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) class.

Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of 
`FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object is loaded/re-loaded from 
any class instances stored in the JSON file `file.json`. As class instances are 
created, updated, or deleted, the `storage` object is used to register 
corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend 
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
(hbnb) 
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the 
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal 
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```

### Console Commands

The HolbertonBnB console supports the following commands:

* **create**
  * Usage: `create <class>`


## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests) 
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
